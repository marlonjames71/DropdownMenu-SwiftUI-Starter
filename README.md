# DropdownMenu-SwiftUI-Starter

DropdownMenu-SwiftUI is a SwiftUI project where we will build a beautiful dropdown menu component in SwiftUI. The component has some nice features and polished UI including:

- Smooth and Interruptible animations
- Can observe other dropdown menus' state
- Nice visual selection indicator
- Haptic feedback using `UIFeedbackGenerator`
- Custom modifiers
- Custom color sets
- Custom Environment Values
- Add as a SwiftUI Library Component

...and more

This starter project was made in order to save a little bit of time on what I'm anticipating already being a long video. So, get your keyboards ready, stretch them fingers, and let's get it!
